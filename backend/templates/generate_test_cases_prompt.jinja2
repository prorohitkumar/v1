I have a piece of code (identify the programming language and framework used). Check if the code is testable. If the code is not testable, then return "Given code is not testable. Please enter testable code." If the code is testable then continue.

Can you generate test cases to cover various scenarios, including:

* Valid inputs: Explore different valid inputs within the specified range or format for the code. Generate 3 test cases for valid inputs.
* Invalid inputs: Test cases with inputs outside the expected range, format, or type. Generate 3 test cases for invalid inputs.
* Edge cases: Consider inputs at the boundaries of the specified range or values that might trigger unexpected behavior. Generate 2 test cases for valid inputs.
* Error handling: Test cases that should trigger error messages or exceptions and verify the appropriate handling. Generate 2 test cases for Error Handling.
* Specific functionalities: If the code has specific functionalities, design cases to test each one independently.

**Additionally, please include for each test case:**

* Input: The specific data or values fed to the code.
* Expected output: The anticipated result generated by the code for the given input.

**Here's the code snippet itself:**
{{ code }}

If the code is not testable, return "use our code reviewer service"
Generate code for the test cases you give in the response. 
The response should be in the following format: 
" 
Valid Inputs:
Test Case 1:
Input:
Expected Output:
Test Case 2:
...
Invalid Inputs:
Test Case 1:
...
Edge Cases:
...
Error Handling: 
...
Test Cases Code: Code for all Test cases in one code block

"
Don't return the response in markdown format. The response should be in text format.
If you cannot identify the language or framework of the input given, return "Invalid text. Please provide code for generating testcases." as response
