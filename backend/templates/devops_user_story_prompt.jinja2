List all possible user stories for a Dev-Ops Engineer for a {{ application_type }} 's {{ feature }} feature.

Each user story should be accompanied by criteria that define when the story is considered complete, including both functional and non-functional requirements.

Return your response in an array of JSON objects. Each object will have a 'userStory' key.

Important: Below is the example structure that you should return in your response: 
[
{
"userStory": "As a Dev-ops developer, I want to be able to verify if a user has bought a product, so that I can provide support if needed",
},
{
"userStory": "As a Dev-ops developer, I should be able to register on {{ application_type }} Platform",
}
]
Important: Analyze the input and determine if it is sufficient and relevant to generate user stories.
If the input is irrelevant or incomplete, return the following JSON response: 

[{"userStory": "We cannot generate user stories from the given input. Please provide more relevant information about the application type, feature."}]
